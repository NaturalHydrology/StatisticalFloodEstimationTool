[COMMENTS]
STATION,Velocity-area station on a straight reach of river with artificially heightened and steeped banks. The control was formerly a gravel bar, in Sep 1977 stabilised with gabions to form an irregular broad-crested weir. Possible movement in control, evident at low flows. Weir is thought to be modular throughout range. All flows contained to date. RATING COMMENTS:Rating derived from current meter gaugings up to 1.6m (about QMED), simple extrapolation beyond.
CATCHMENT,Predominantly carboniferous rocks. Altitudes: 430mAOD (max), 8mAOD (min). Lower catchment agricultural. Forest cover 5%. Minimal floodplains. Relatively un-flashy. Hydrometric Register BFI= 0.65. ARTIFICIAL INFLUENCES:There are a number of small storage reservoirs in catchment and Loch Leven whose outflow is controlled by sluice gates. Effluent return and industrial/agricultural abstractions probably don't significantly influence flood peaks. CATCHMENT CHANGES:No significant changes known.
Qmed Suitability,Rating review required for all periods (recommendation made in 2003 at time of HIFLOWS data compilation)
Pooling Suitability,Rating review required for all periods (recommendation made in 2003 at time of HIFLOWS data compilation)
