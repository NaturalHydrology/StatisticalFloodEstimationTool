[COMMENTS]
STATION,Opened in 1971, this is one of the earliest stations on the Mourne system. A velocity-area station with timber hut on RH bank, OWK16 shaft encoder with telemetry and chart backup. Cableway used to have a winch but this was removed at some stage. RATING COMMENTS:Rating derived from current meter gaugings. Rating was good but is now in need of updating as no high flow gaugings have been carried out in a while. Low flow gauging is carried out at the bridge downstream.
CATCHMENT,Predominantly agricultural grassland with some upland heath and coniferous forest. Solid geology - Dalradian schistose sandstone and shale form generally impermeable basement in the south. Much of the area is underlain by Carboniferous, generally indurated conglomerate, Claragh sandstone, mudstone and limestone. Prominent Palaeogene dolerite dykes cross the area. Drift geology - river alluvium overlies glacial sand and gravel deposited on drumlinised glacial till. Rock near surface and post-glacial peat extensive on high ground. Restricted development of river alluvium in valleys. ARTIFICIAL INFLUENCES:No water abstractions or significant returns. CATCHMENT CHANGES:No information available
Qmed Suitability,Qmed approximately at bankfull stage, and belived to be reasonably reliable
Pooling Suitability,Rating extrapolated beyond bankfull, and although unmeasured bypass believed to be around 10% of total flows, not suitable for pooling.
