[COMMENTS]
STATION,'Essex' profile (modified Flat V Crump) weir with crest tapping measuring up to 1.21m - limit of reliable gauging. Higher flows estimated. Drowning commences at 0.6m, and varies in severity. Naturalised flows 1970-1976. Adjustments needed for effluent discharges. RATING COMMENTS:One rating applied across period of record.Hydraulic model used to derive rating for high flows. Reasonable fit to gaugings.
CATCHMENT,Rural, agricultural catchment. Boulder Clay and glacial gravel covering Chalk in extreme north, London Clay elsewhere. ARTIFICIAL INFLUENCES:Minimal abstractions. STW and industrial effluent discharges. CATCHMENT CHANGES:No information available
Qmed Suitability,QMED within bank and well gauged.
Pooling Suitability,Confident in performance of model derived rating for out of bank flows.
